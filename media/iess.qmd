From 5 to 16 July 2025, twelve Jesuits representing four continents took part in the first-ever Integral Ecology Summer School, a landmark initiative led by the Integral Ecology Research Network.

Participants were selected for their pastoral, academic, or professional engagement with ecological issues—ranging from scientific research and theological enquiry to hands-on projects with vulnerable and marginalised communities. The Summer School created a unique space for exploring integral ecology through a Jesuit lens, shaped by global diversity and local commitment.

## From Oxford to the Borderlands

The programme unfolded in two distinct locations. The first half took place at Campion Hall, the Jesuit hall at the University of Oxford, where participants were welcomed by Dr Patrick Goujon SJ, Superior of the community, and Dr Peter Rožič SJ, Director of the Integral Ecology Research Network. These opening days focused on intellectual formation, spiritual grounding, and community building—set against the backdrop of Campion’s long tradition of academic and social engagement at Oxford. The second half of the programme moved to Belmont Abbey, a Benedictine monastery near Hereford on the border of England and Wales, offering a change of pace and a chance to deepen reflection in a contemplative, rural setting. Here, the emphasis shifted to ecological spirituality, prayer, and hands-on learning in nature.
