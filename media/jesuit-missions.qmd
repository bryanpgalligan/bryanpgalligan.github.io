Jesuit Missions is the international mission and development organisation of the Jesuits in Britain. For more than 60 years, we have supported vulnerable and marginalized communities in the Global South. This podcast showcases the people we meet, support and work with in our ambitions to create a more just world inspired by our faith.

We spoke with Bryan Galligan, an American Jesuit scholastic who specializes in climate justice and food security. Bryan has spent time conducting research in East Africa, where he saw firsthand how extreme weather patterns can have disastrous consequences for local communities.
