Why send an American Jesuit in formation to Kenya? For Bryan Galligan, SJ, his two years serving at the Jesuit Justice and Ecology Network Africa meant new relationships, a deepening understanding of the global Church and a lot of fish. 

Thanks to the Jesuit Conference of Africa and Madagascar for aiding in the production of this video. Thanks to Ronald Baya for providing Swahili translations and voiceover. All music was licensed through Audiio. All filming, production and editing was done by the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States communications team.
