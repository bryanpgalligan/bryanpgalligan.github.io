On October 4, 2023, just two months before UNFCCC COP28, Pope Francis released a new pastoral document addressing the climate crisis. This document, *Laudate Deum*, is addressed “to all people of good will” and is intended to be an addendum to *Laudato Si’*, the Pope’s groundbreaking 2015 encyclical on the global environmental and social crisis. It also draws on his 2020 letter, *Fratelli tutti*, which called for transformative global political and economic reform in the spirit of social friendship.

*Laudate Deum* begins by making clear that the climate crisis is a moral concern of the utmost importance. Francis reminds us that climate change is primarily a question of good and evil, and he quotes the African bishops to make his point: “to express bluntly that this is no longer a secondary or ideological question, but a drama that harms us all, the African bishops stated that climate change makes manifest ‘a tragic and striking example of structural sin.’"
