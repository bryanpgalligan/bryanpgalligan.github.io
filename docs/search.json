Combining this information with large-scale estimates of fish production by artificial intelligence algorithms has now allowed for estimates of nutrient delivery. These estimates suggest that nutrient production is influenced by fish species and body sizes and that maximizing sustained yield production is the best way to increase nutrient delivery.\nRead the full summary here."

    "text": "My interest in the intersection between marine ecosystems and aquatic food systems is a product of my desire to ask and answer ecological questions that have practical importance for coastal people and ecosystems. Most of my work focuses on understanding how environmental influences and management decisions drive (1) population and community ecology in marine systems and (2) the quantity and quality of food production from fisheries. My published work includes studies on commercial fisheries in the northeastern United States, artisanal coral reef fisheries in East Africa and the Western Indian Ocean, and the global governance of marine biodiversity and livelihoods."

    "text": "Research Themes\n\nThe production of dietary nutrients for human consumption\nAs the only globally significant source of food production derived from wild ecosystems, marine fisheries are remarkably heterogeneous in terms of the quantity and quality of food they can provide. Most of my work on coral reef ecosystems has included an emphasis on quantifying fishery production in a way that is meaningful for nutrition and public health while also understanding how to better design nutrition-sensitive management strategies within the bounds of sustainability (e.g., Galligan & McClanahan, 2024).\n\nGalligan, B. P., & McClanahan, T. R. (2024). Tropical fishery nutrient production depends on biomass-based management. iScience, 27(4), 109420.\n\n\n\nBoats pulled up at a seasonal fishing camp in Lamu, Kenya\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of environmental change and management on fishery ecosystems\nUnprecedented levels of anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, overfishing, and eutrophication have created significant uncertainty regarding the futures of coastal ecosystems and fisheries, sometimes transforming ecosystem dynamics in counterintuitive or unanticipated ways. At the same time, management decisions seeking to mitigate or adapt to these pressures can also lead to unintended consequences. By combining environmental and ecological datasets, I have studied the impacts of wastewater treatment on northern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria) in Narragansett Bay, the failure of steep reductions in fishing effort to secure the recovery of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) in southern Rhode Island, and the effectiveness of management strategies such as balanced harvest and gear modification on Kenyan coral reefs (e.g., Galligan et al., 2022).\n\nGalligan, B. P., Stuart, Y. E., McManus, M. C., & Stoffel, H. E. (2022). Hypoxia-induced predation refuge for northern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria) in a temperate estuary. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 265, 107732.\n\n\n\nOne of southern New England’s many coastal bird species, the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus)\n\n\n\n\nManagement and policy solutions for sustainability and justice in coastal communities\nGovernments must act to restore and protect marine biodiversity while also securing the rights of coastal people, but power relations and technical challenges present significant obstacles to improved governance. I have thus worked to combine my scientific expertise with ethical reflection on concrete policy options to inform global and local governance of coastal ecosystems and food systems (e.g. Galligan et al., 2024). Beyond scholarly articles, I have also engaged in policy advocacy in various fora, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nGalligan, B. P., Saldivar, F.
