As the waters flowed east, the river became deeper and gained strength, bringing life to all it touched and renewing relationships both human and ecological. As one commentator argues, this post-trauma promise of consolation was as much about “restoration of the land” as “restoration to the land.” Ezekiel’s vision of restoration also included an abundance of fish, notable both for their beauty and their role as food.\nToday, as in Ezekiel’s time, God’s promise of healing and restoration applies to relationships that are human, ecological, and aquatic. And yet, so many of today’s conversations about water neglect rich perspectives like Ezekiel’s. In particular, they neglect the importance of wild capture fisheries, and especially small-scale fisheries, in the ongoing struggle for ecosocial justice. Many countries’ exclusion of fisheries from national food policies provides but one salient example. In what follows, we make a case for the importance of small-scale fisheries and describe how they are simultaneously threatened by a “blue” turn in economic development and a failure of imagination on the part of those interested in helping them. We then turn to the case of a traditional fishing community in Lamu, Kenya, in order to illustrate these trends and seek guidance for ways forward.\nRead the full article here."

The survey deployed fyke nets throughout the winter spawning season in Point Judith Pond, Potter Pond, and Ninigret Pond beginning in the winter of 1998–1999. Sampling variables (e.g., location, soak period) and environmental variables (e.g., water temperature, precipitation) were either collected during the survey or compiled from external sources. Random forest models were used to predict relationships between candidate predictors and the occurrence and abundance of Winter Flounder in the catch.\n\n\nResults\nSeasonality (day of year) was strongly predictive of Winter Flounder capture, while most environmental variables were not, suggesting consistently timed migration and spawning movements that do not respond to environmental cues. Water temperature predicted abundance but not occurrence, consistent with previous observations of behavioral adaptations but not taxis during cold periods.\n\n\nConclusions\nThe decoupling of environmental parameters from Winter Flounder catch rates suggests that behavioral rigidity in breeding adults may contribute to this species’ lack of recovery. Improved abundance predictions suggest a continued decline for Rhode Island Winter Flounder.\nAccess the full article here."

Most of my work on coral reef ecosystems has included an emphasis on quantifying fishery production in a way that is meaningful for nutrition and public health while also understanding how to better design nutrition-sensitive management strategies within the bounds of sustainability (e.g., Galligan & McClanahan, 2024).\n\nGalligan, B.

At the same time, management decisions seeking to mitigate or adapt to these pressures can also lead to unintended consequences. By combining environmental and ecological datasets, I have studied the impacts of wastewater treatment on northern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria) in Narragansett Bay, the failure of steep reductions in fishing effort to secure the recovery of winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) in southern Rhode Island, and the effectiveness of management strategies such as balanced harvest and gear modification on Kenyan coral reefs (e.g., Galligan et al., 2022).\n\nGalligan, B.

I have thus worked to combine my scientific expertise with ethical reflection on concrete policy options to inform global and local governance of coastal ecosystems and food systems (e.g. Galligan et al., 2024). Beyond scholarly articles, I have also engaged in policy advocacy in various fora, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nGalligan, B. P., Saldivar, F.

Early recommendations have included targeting small fishes and increasing the species richness of fish catches, which could represent a departure from more traditional approaches such as biomass-based management. To test these recommendations, we compared the outcomes of biomass-based management with hypothesized factors influencing nutrient density in nearshore artisanal fish catches in the Western Indian Ocean. We found that enhancing nutrient production depends primarily on achieving biomass-based targets. Catches dominated by low- and mid-trophic level species with smaller body sizes and faster turnover were associated with modest increases in nutrient densities, but the variability in nutrient density was small relative to human nutritional requirements. Therefore, tropical fishery management should focus on restoring biomass to achieve maximum yields and sustainability, particularly for herbivorous fishes.\nAccess the full article here."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRecent policy recommendations have highlighted the nutritional benefits of fisheries that capture small finfish species. Small fish, particularly those that feed in the pelagic zone, tend to be more nutrient dense than larger species, with increased concentrations of calcium, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. However, capturing fish below some recommended size limit (i.e., length at first maturity = Lmat) in coral reefs is frequently considered to be unsustainable and associated with reduced yields and losses of ecosystem functions. To evaluate the potential effects of fish body size, we analyzed nutrient concentrations of 424 demersal and pelagic finfish species reported from Western Indian Ocean artisanal fisheries. We found that length and food source are associated with only small differences in nutrient density in the artisanal catches of this region (≤7% of a child’s daily requirement in most cases). We also analyzed 20 years of catch monitoring data from Kenya, where many of the common species have Lmat ∼20–25 cm, to test the potential benefits and tradeoffs of capturing small fishes. Small capture sizes were associated with low yields and sexually immature catches with a mean length of 15 cm resulting in 38% lower catch per unit effort, 37% lower nutrient yield, and a 22% lower maturity index compared to a mean body length of 30 cm. Catches of undersized fish were not associated with substantial increases or decreases in nutrient content relative to human nutritional requirements. Thus, coral reef artisanal fisheries should target moderate to large fishes (&gt;20 cm) to maximize overall yield, nutrient yield, and sustainability.\nAccess the full article here."

It also draws on his 2020 letter, Fratelli tutti, which called for transformative global political and economic reform in the spirit of social friendship.\nLaudate Deum begins by making clear that the climate crisis is a moral concern of the utmost importance. Francis reminds us that climate change is primarily a question of good and evil, and he quotes the African bishops to make his point: “to express bluntly that this is no longer a secondary or ideological question, but a drama that harms us all, the African bishops stated that climate change makes manifest ‘a tragic and striking example of structural sin.’”\nRead the full article here."

Under the legal definition, genocide can only happen to certain types of human groups, be accomplished through a limited list of acts, and be said to take place only where there is specific intent “to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such.” Lemkin’s original conception was much richer.\nRead the full article here.\n\n\n\nSatellite picture of the Amazon rainforest.

He would have been joined by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and Rev. Jim Wallace, moderator of the Church of Scotland. Together, the three faith leaders were hoping to build on momentum established back in 2019, when Francis and Welby hosted South Sudanese political leaders for a spiritual retreat at the Vatican. That event—in particular the poignant moment when Francis bowed to kiss the feet of each attendee—marked a turning point for the troubled African country, where civil war had been raging for six years. Not long after their visit to Rome, on February 22, 2020, President Salva Kiir and First Vice President Riek Machar, the opposition leader, announced the end of hostilities. It was an extraordinary development: while the South Sudanese peace process has been sluggish, and sporadic fighting has continued, this previously unthinkable display of unity signaled real progress.\nWhenever their visit occurs, Francis, Welby, and Wallace should harbor no illusions about the brutality of South Sudan’s recent history and the difficulties it poses for creating a lasting peace. The country has been split along ethnic lines since violence erupted in December 2013, two years after the referendum that formalized South Sudan’s independence. Just hours after Kiir accused Machar of plotting a coup, Dinka soldiers loyal to the former stormed the streets of the South Sudanese capital, Juba, systematically rounding up, torturing, and killing members of Machar’s Nuer ethnic group. Weeks later, Nuer militias responded by attacking the city of Bor, about 130 miles to the north, overwhelming government troops, raping and killing women in their hospital beds, beating men and children to death, and gunning down anyone who tried to escape. All told, some two thousand civilians were killed. Since then, hundreds of thousands more have died as a result of atrocities committed by both sides.\nRead the full article here.\n\n\n\nInternally displaced people in Yambio, South Sudan, September 2021 (CNS photo/Sean Hawkey"

My research studies the connections between marine ecosystems, small-scale fisheries, and public health nutrition in order to create impact for communities and policy, both in the Western Indian Ocean and the northeastern United States. Most of my work focuses on understanding how environmental influences and management decisions drive population and community ecology in marine systems, and how they affect the quantity and nutritional quality of fish catches. I also write about the ethical dimensions of ocean governance with a focus on human rights and social justice."

    "text": "From 5 to 16 July 2025, twelve Jesuits representing four continents took part in the first-ever Integral Ecology Summer School, a landmark initiative led by the Integral Ecology Research Network.\nParticipants were selected for their pastoral, academic, or professional engagement with ecological issues—ranging from scientific research and theological enquiry to hands-on projects with vulnerable and marginalised communities. The Summer School created a unique space for exploring integral ecology through a Jesuit lens, shaped by global diversity and local commitment."

The first half took place at Campion Hall, the Jesuit hall at the University of Oxford, where participants were welcomed by Dr Patrick Goujon SJ, Superior of the community, and Dr Peter Rožič SJ, Director of the Integral Ecology Research Network. These opening days focused on intellectual formation, spiritual grounding, and community building—set against the backdrop of Campion’s long tradition of academic and social engagement at Oxford. The second half of the programme moved to Belmont Abbey, a Benedictine monastery near Hereford on the border of England and Wales, offering a change of pace and a chance to deepen reflection in a contemplative, rural setting. Here, the emphasis shifted to ecological spirituality, prayer, and hands-on learning in nature.\nRead the full article here."

    "text": "While richer western countries direct funding via national conservation strategies and national “red lists,” the IUCN red list has become a de facto conservation priorities list in many developing countries, argue its critics. The dynamic between global north and south has been historically underappreciated, says Hughes, with most specialist groups still conducted in English or another UN language, leaving voices across Asia in particular among those likely to get lost.\nRead the full article here.
