Since 2021, I have studied the relationship between fishery management, ecological function, and the production of dietary nutrients in artisanal coral reef fisheries of the Western Indian Ocean. Using data from Kenya, we found that traditional management measures, such as modifying gears to avoid capture of undersized fishes, targeting medium and large body sizes, and restoring reef fish biomass, are associated with higher nutrient yields in unselective coral reef fisheries (Galligan, McClanahan, et al., 2022; Galligan & McClanahan, 2024).

However, as Narragansett Bay becomes more oligotrophic and experiences fewer episodes of hypoxia due to improved wastewater treatment, trophic relationships are changing in space and time. I collaborated with researchers at Loyola University Chicago and the Rhode Island Division of Marine Fisheries to study the impacts of these changes on Narragansett Bay quahogs and found evidence that improved water quality has made juvenile clams more vulnerable to predators, leading to smaller cohorts and lower recruitment (Galligan, Stuart, et al., 2022).\n\nGalligan, B.

Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.”\n\nMy own “integrated approach” has meant incorporating ethical reflection and policy advocacy alongside scientific research. It also motivates me to work with marginalized communities and produce the kinds of knowledge that will serve their needs.
