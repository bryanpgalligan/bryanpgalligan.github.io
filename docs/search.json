Combining this information with large-scale estimates of fish production by artificial intelligence algorithms has now allowed for estimates of nutrient delivery. These estimates suggest that nutrient production is influenced by fish species and body sizes and that maximizing sustained yield production is the best way to increase nutrient delivery.\nRead the full summary here."

The combination of environmental change with the availability of several long-term data sets makes this region a fascinating natural laboratory. With researchers at the Rhode Island Division of Marine Fisheries, I investigated relationships between water quality and Narragansett Bay Quahog Mercenaria mercenaria abundance. We found evidence that reduced hypoxia has made juvenile clams more vulnerable to predators, leading to smaller cohorts and lower recruitment in areas where hypoxic refugia have diminished (Galligan, Stuart, et al., 2022). I currently have active projects studying both Quahogs and Winter Flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus.\n\nGalligan, B. P., Stuart, Y. E., McManus, M. C., & Stoffel, H. E. (2022).

Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.”\n\nMy own “integrated approach” has meant incorporating ethical reflection and policy advocacy alongside scientific research. It also motivates me to work with marginalized communities and produce the kinds of knowledge that will serve their needs. For a full explanation of what integral ecology can look like as a research method, see the briefing note I developed in collaboration with a colleague at the Laudato Si’ Research Institute at the University of Oxford (Zepeda & Galligan, 2023). In the past, I have worked to put fisheries law and policy in conversation with social ethics (Galligan, 2021; Galligan et al., 2024).
