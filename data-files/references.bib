	abstract = {In Lamu, Kenya, small-scale fisheries are an integral part of culture, livelihoods, and the local economy. Unfortunately, this vibrant region on Kenya's north coast is under threat from a large-scale development project that affects local communities and the natural ecosystems on which they rely. The implementation of the SSF Guidelines, and particularly the guidelines' emphasis on protecting small-scale fishers' human rights, could provide local communities with a measure of protection from these threats. In recent years, the community in Lamu has worked in precisely that direction, fighting and winning a lawsuit against several government agencies that ruled to protect fishers' constitutional rights to life, culture, a clean and healthy environment, and property. To document this struggle and draw lessons from it, we conducted a literature review and legal analysis, also drawing on our personal experience with the community in question. The court's novel interpretation of Kenya's 2010 Constitution makes clear the integral connection between basic human rights and the protection of small-scale fisheries, providing a model for other communities whose rights are threatened by large development projects. At the same time, there is a risk of the 2018 judgment being only a victory on paper as the case continues to wind its way through appeals. There is a wide gap between the court's ruling and the concrete reality on the ground in Lamu where, despite the ruling, part of the port project has become operational while the remainder is under construction, resulting in environmental damage and the displacement of fishers from their traditional fishing grounds. Despite the continuing failure of the Kenyan government to protect fishers in Lamu, these events nonetheless demonstrate that the SSF Guidelines can be progressively implemented when fishers and civil society make rights-based legal demands.},

	abstract = {Coral reef artisanal fisheries are an important source of nutrition and economic wellbeing for coastal communities, but their management is subject to conflicts and tradeoffs between short-term food security benefits and long-term ecological function. One potential tradeoff is between nutrient capture and fish yields, where targeting small, nutrient-dense species may be more valuable for food security than maximizing fish yields, which is more closely aligned with supporting biodiversity and ecological function. We explored these potential tradeoffs by comparing two similar gears: traditional African basket traps and traps modified with an escape gap. Traps without escape gaps captured a higher frequency of fish with body sizes below their estimated lengths at maximum sustainable yield than gated traps. Estimates of nutrient yields for six micronutrients among the 208 captured species indicated high hump-shaped relationships for gated traps and low and linear positive relationships for traditional traps. Maximum nutrients in gated traps frequently corresponded to body sizes at maximum sustainable yield. Daily capture rates of nutrients were above daily needs more often in gated than traditional traps, but calcium values were low in both trap designs. Gated traps were more likely to capture species with unique and potentially important functional traits, including browsing herbivores, which could have negative effects on ecological functions and reef recovery. However, gated traps also catch fewer immature fish and fewer predators. Our results indicate that nutrient yields can be maximized while using a gear that captures larger and more sustainable body sizes in coral reef artisanal fisheries. Preferential targeting of nutrient-dense fishes is only one of many metrics for evaluating a nutrition-centered management strategy and may only be a management target in specific contexts.},

	abstract = {Oxygen depletion in estuaries and coastal waters is often associated with reduced biodiversity, coastal dead zones, and the loss of important ecosystem services. However, some species can benefit from low oxygen conditions due to the indirect effects these conditions have on trophic relationships. In Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, U.S.A., northern quahogs (Mercenaria mercenaria) reach their highest densities in the areas of the Bay most prone to oxygen depletion. One line of evidence suggests that suboxic events (hypoxia and anoxia) can aid quahogs by excluding predators. Here, we analyze data from long-term surveys of water quality and quahog abundances to test whether a hypoxia-induced predation refuge is strong enough to explain quahog population dynamics in Narragansett Bay. We found that quahog cohorts were larger when they had been exposed to low oxygen conditions as juveniles, consistent with the predation refuge hypothesis. However, cohort size was also strongly associated with location and year settled, suggesting that a predation refuge is but one of a suite of factors influencing M. mercenaria populations.},

@article{galligan2021,
	abstract = {Approaches to global fisheries governance generally fall into one of two broad categories, tending to rely either on an extractivist model that prioritizes macroeconomic growth or a norms-based model that subordinates economic processes to ethical social objectives. While global fisheries could contribute much more effectively and directly to fulfilling the human right to subsistence (an ethical norm that is as universal and binding as any under international law), their potential to do so is undermined by legal structures that favor the extractivist model and fail to legislate ethical norms. These legal structures undermine the human right to subsistence, in large part by marginalizing small-scale fisheries, which provide for the subsistence needs of many more food-insecure people around the world than do their industrial counterparts. After illustrating the conflict between extractivism and ethical norms in international fisheries law, this article turns to the case of South African small-scale fisheries, which provides a more concrete and place-based view of these power dynamics and demonstrates the resilience of the extractivist paradigm in the face of norms-based challenges. If global fisheries are to contribute more fully to the realization of the human right to subsistence, the extractivist model will need to be seriously constrained and ethical norms will have to be given pride of place in fisheries law and policy.},
