    "text": "Nutrient yields from small-scale fisheries\nSmall-scale fisheries (SSF) are an important source of food, nutrition, and income in developing countries, but they face many challenges and are often neglected in policy and management. In addition to providing important benefits for people, SSF often take place in highly complex social and ecological systems and tend to be understudied relative to industrial fisheries. This project uses catch data and information about the nutritional value of fished species to ask questions about social and ecological trade offs in fishery management. Can we sustainably increase the quantity and quality of food produced by SSF? Where SSF take place in the tropics, can we preserve coral reef ecological function without compromising food security? The first publication from this project shows that managing Kenyan trap fisheries to target fish with larger, more sustainable body sizes is associated with improved nutrient yields (Galligan et al., 2022)."

Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.”\n\nFrancis believes that these integrated, solution-oriented strategies should take on the contours of what he calls “integral ecology.” This project, which I am working on in collaboration with the Laudato Si’ Research Institute, is about figuring out what integral ecology means for research, policy, and practice. How does an integral ecology paradigm invite new approaches to knowledge production? Are these methods different for academics from different disciplines?

    "text": "In the wake of a devastating annual report on hunger and malnutrition, and in the lead-up to the controversial UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS), the international community is at a point of reckoning. Despite ambitious goals, a business-as-usual approach to food systems has not made progress. Indeed, COVID-19 and climate change have disrupted food production and supply chains around the world, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of people experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity. According to the FAO, almost one in three people did not have access to adequate food in 2020 and the food security gender gap was increasing. In Africa, where food insecurity is most prevalent, 60% of people experienced moderate or severe food insecurity in the same year. It is not surprising, then, that civil society and corporate actors alike are calling for radical changes to the way food systems are governed. And yet these changes as currently proposed have some important blind spots, especially around aquatic foods.\nThe conversation around food systems governance is only just beginning to recognize the role played by aquatic foods—marine and inland capture fisheries, aquaculture, and mariculture—in providing protein and micronutrients to billions. Only two out of the 120 affiliated sessions at the UNFSS Pre-Summit mentioned aquatic foods in their titles. And this is despite the fact, according to the FAO, that fish account for about 17% of animal protein consumption globally. Furthermore, in many countries where malnutrition is prevalent, existing fisheries landings could already provide more than enough micronutrients for coastal populations. Clearly, something has gone wrong here. Why hasn’t the food governance conversation extended to aquatic foods? And why are hunger and malnutrition on the rise when the production of aquatic foods has never been higher?"

    "section": "The Problem of Fisheries Extractivism",
    "text": "The Problem of Fisheries Extractivism\nA partial answer to both of these questions has to do with the governance of capture fisheries. Fisheries are simply not governed with food security in mind. Rather, the law and policy devices used to control and “optimize” fisheries production overwhelmingly reflect a management paradigm that attempts to maximize economic growth at the expense of legitimate ethical social objectives. This is fisheries extractivism, and it is at least partially responsible for the shared myopia of both food systems governance and fisheries management.\nThe extractivist model of fisheries governance primarily views marine living resources as potential drivers of economic growth. This model’s goal is to extract marine resources at or close to their maximum sustainable yield (MSY), trade them as commodities, and optimize the economic efficiency of these processes. The macroeconomic growth this model pursues is either considered to be the best way to contribute to overall human well being or is considered to be a sufficient good in its own right. Either way, normative considerations are secondary if they enter the discussion at all.\nA norms-based model, on the other hand, would foreground and prioritize ethical and legal norms as governing principles for fisheries. Examples of this model would include a sustainable livelihoods or human rights-based approach to fisheries management; the FAO’s Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication (SSF Guidelines) could also be considered to follow the norms-based model. Under this model, marine living resources are utilized first to provide food and livelihoods for those who most need them. Economic growth is considered to be a means, not an end, and states take on legal obligations to manage their fisheries in ways designed to fulfill their ethical commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtractivist Model\nNorms-Based Model\n\n\n\n\nIn Legislation\nClear and binding provisions are jurisdictional or economic in nature.\nClear and binding provisions address ethical social objectives.\n\n\nGeneral Policy Goal\nMacroeconomic growth\nFulfillment of human rights or other ethical demands\n\n\nFisheries-Specific Policy Goals\nEconomic efficiency and maximum exploitation\nJust distribution of access rights and maximum contribution to local food security\n\n\nFish and Fishery Products\nDefined primarily as commodities\nDefined primarily as food\n\n\n\nSadly, the extractivist model is overwhelmingly the normal state of affairs in fisheries governance today. Take UNCLOS (the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea), for example. This foundational document for ocean governance also lays the foundations for fisheries extractivism. Throughout the treaty, provisions with clear and binding language are reserved for economic and jurisdictional concerns. Article 56, which provides the legal basis for states’ exclusive economic zones (EEZs), and Article 62, on maximum exploitation of the total allowable catch (TAC), exemplify this type of provision. On the other hand, those parts of UNCLOS having to do with ethical concerns like food security are qualified by language that imposes no strong requirements. Consider Article 62, which provides states with instructions on how they are to allocate fishing rights to other nations. Here, a list of important ethical priorities appears, including “the need to minimize social dislocation” and “the requirements of developing states.” Unfortunately, the only legal requirement in Article 62 is that states “consider” these priorities. There is no requirement that fisheries be managed for food security.\nThis extractivist pattern is also dominant in national fisheries governance documents, where legislative and policymaking bodies often produce lists of objectives intended to guide fisheries management. Normally, these lists include both economic growth and food security, but do not confront tradeoffs between the two. As a result, governments are consistently failing to maximize the contribution of fisheries to local food security."

    "section": "Blue Justice",
    "text": "Blue Justice\nThe global dominance of fisheries extractivism, and the corresponding failure to implement norms-based governance models, has directly undermined the food security of coastal peoples around the world. This situation is particularly problematic in Africa, where the proportion of people facing hunger in 2020 was more than double that in any other region. Fisheries extractivism reigns here as well. In South Africa, COVID-19 lockdowns prevented many artisanal fishers from practicing their trade and obtaining food for themselves and their communities. In Ghana, artisanal fishers make significant contributions to food and nutrition security, but their supply of fish is threatened by competition from industrial foreign fleets. Even the African Union’s 2050 Integrated Maritime Strategy offers little more than a friendly mention to food security while it repeatedly emphasizes the importance of economic growth. These are not the right priorities. Africa and the world badly need an alternative to fisheries extractivism.\nThat alternative is blue justice. The term ‘blue justice’ first made its way into the academic literature in Svein Jentoft’s 2019 book, Life Above Water. And while the term is still “in its infancy,” the concepts on which it draws are well established in social ethics. They also happen to be consistent with states’ existing human rights commitments. A recent formulation highlights three components of blue justice: recognitional justice, procedural justice, and distributional justice, each of which is then used to identify specific marine policy recommendations. The most significant element of blue justice, however, is the demand that it be the primary lens for ocean governance. Rather than place ethical concerns like food security among a list of other goals with no clear priorities, blue justice contends that the wellbeing of people and communities ought to be at the center of any ocean governance process. This does not a priori exclude economic growth, but it puts economic growth in its place, making it a means to human development rather than an end in itself.\nCurrent trends in the governance of both food systems and capture fisheries are failing to provide for those most in need. This is particularly true in Sub-Saharan Africa. Rectifying these egregious mistakes and maximizing aquatic foods’ contributions to food and nutrition security will require that policymakers frame their initiatives in ethical, and not primarily economic, terms. We need blue justice, not fisheries extractivism.\nFor more on fisheries extractivism and the right to subsistence, see my new paper here.\nThis post was originally shared on the JENA Blog."

    "text": "East Africa’s coral reef fisheries are threatened by climate change, overexploitation, and poor management. And in this part of the world, where artisanal fisheries are a key source of food and income for coastal communities, these threats have direct impacts on food security. One way to make these fisheries more sustainable is to target larger, sexually mature fishes, and let juvenile fish grow to reproduce at least once before they are removed from the ecosystem. This is what managers, researchers, and communities have been doing for years by modifying traditional African fish traps with an escape gap for undersize fish (“gated traps”).\nPrevious work on these gated traps has found that they improve the sustainability and quantity of the fish caught while also increasing fishers’ incomes. They are also more sustainable than some other gears used in artisanal reef fisheries, such as beach seines and gillnets. Our latest paper (Galligan et al., 2022) is the most comprehensive evaluation of these new traps to date. We developed a suite of indicators to compare how gated traps affect the ecological function of coral reefs and the food security of coastal communities.\nA key concern was that the catch from gated traps might be of a lower nutritional quality than the catch from traditional traps. Although targeting larger individuals and species (as gated traps do) is generally considered to be more sustainable and to produce more total fish, it could also lead to unintended consequences if smaller fish species are more nutrient dense than larger ones (Figure 1). We were also interested in whether gated traps target species with different ecological functions than traditional traps.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Plot concentration against species size\nggplot(trap.species, aes(x = Lmat_cm, y = Calcium_mgPer100g)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 250)) +\n  labs(title = \"Calcium Concentrations by Size\",\n    x = expression(paste(\"Length at Maturity (\", L[mat], \") (cm)\", sep = \"\")),\n    y = expression(\n      paste(\"Calcium Concentration \",\n        bgroup(\"(\", frac('mg', '100g'), \")\"),\n        sep = \"\"))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\"),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), \"cm\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: In Kenya’s artisanal trap fishery, smaller species are richer in calcium than larger ones.\n\n\n\n\nOur indicators showed that gated traps perform better than traditional traps for food security, but had mixed results for ecological function. There is really no way to remove fish from coral reefs without affecting ecosystem functioning, and gated traps seem to impact the reef differently from traditional traps, but not better or worse.\nWhile some small species tended to be more nutrient dense than larger ones, this is not a universal trend. As a result, there were no pronounced tradeoffs between food security and ecological function. Instead, we found that length-based estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) frequently correlated with more nutritious catches in gated traps (Figure 2).\n\nCalciumIronOmega-3Vitamin ASeleniumZinc\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# GAMM for calcium yield -

In late-night negotiations that ended in the early hours of Sunday, November 20, parties successfully reached a deal to establish a long-awaited and much-discussed mechanism for loss and damage finance. The agreement, which came after years of concerted effort on the part of civil society and developing countries, was “a real pinch-me moment,” according to Teresa Anderson of ActionAid. But this high-profile outcome was but one of the many decisions taken at COP27.\nThe conference’s agreement on food also represents an important step forward, although it includes some key weaknesses. As we reported in the days before COP27, the future of the UNFCCC’s only dedicated work stream on food, the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture, was set to be decided as delegates met in Sharm el-Sheikh. This was an incredibly important, although under-discussed, item on the agenda. Food systems are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and climate action must be designed in a way that supports the resilience of small-scale producers in frontline communities around the world. Without a strong emphasis on food that is centered on principles of justice and equity, national climate change policies will fail. This is especially true in Africa, where approximately 70% of the population relies on agricultural livelihoods. This is why food security is emphasized in the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, and even the brand-new Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan. Food systems transformation is an indispensable component of climate action.\nHere are the key outcomes for food systems from COP27:"

    "text": "An expanded mandate for food security\nAs the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture is replaced by the Sharm el-Sheikh Joint Work on Implementation of Climate Action on Agriculture and Food Security, negotiators have taken an important step to expand the UNFCCC’s mandate to address food systems in a more holistic and integrated manner. Where the previous work program had a narrow focus on agricultural production, its successor will promote “a holistic approach to addressing issues related to agriculture and food security.” While negotiators did not agree to include a food systems mandate in the text, this still represents a substantial step forward.\nThere are two definitions of food security that carry legal weight in the international system, and both would introduce important elements into the Sharm el-Sheikh joint work that were not included in Koronivia. Member states of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have agreed that food security has four pillars: physical availability, physical and economic access, utilization through an adequate diet and the meeting of all physiological needs, and stability of prices and supplies over short and long timescales. Another highly influential definition from the High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) adds the pillars of sustainability and agency to the FAO’s original four, thus mainstreaming concerns for human rights, democratic governance, and ecological integrity. By defining a “holistic…food security” mandate, the Sharm el-Sheikh joint work is already signaling that it intends to leave behind Koronivia’s outdated focus on production."

The agreement includes a strong focus on the importance of small-scale food producers, describing them as “stewards of the land” and highlighting their importance as “key agents of change.” It also highlights the vulnerability and importance of indigenous and local communities, women, and youth in adapting to the effects of climate change, and calls for their participation and inclusion in policy formulation.\nCrucially, the Sharm el-Sheikh work program’s mandate also includes cooperating with “the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, and the Special Climate Change Fund,” which establishes an avenue to provide more and better targeted resources in support of small-scale food producers. This should mean that existing climate finance has a clearer path to reach those who most need it. There is also space in the mandate to cooperate with other UN bodies, like the CFS, which provides important policy guidelines through a transparent process that is inclusive of civil society and indigenous and local communities. An explicit linkage with the CFS would consolidate this progress and provide the work program with increased legitimacy in global food systems governance."

At COP27, interventions from the Climate Action Network on behalf of environmental NGOs and South Sudan on behalf of the Least Developed Countries featured calls for the consideration of fisherfolk alongside other types of food producers in the successor to Koronivia. Considering that aquatic animal-source foods account for 17% of global protein consumption, no food systems policy can be complete without them. COP27’s call for a holistic approach to food security should be interpreted to include aquatic food systems.\nA second stream of work under the UNFCCC provides additional support for the inclusion of aquatic food systems after Sharm el-Sheikh. In 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact invited all of the UNFCCC’s work programs to “consider how to integrate and strengthen ocean-based action in their existing mandates and work plans.” The Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan renewed that call, encouraged Parties to include ocean action in their national frameworks, and made a provision for continued ocean dialogues to provide input into other UNFCCC processes. It also recalled the outcomes of the 2022 ocean dialogue, held in Bonn on June 15, which emphasized the importance of improved fisheries management, ecosystem conservation and restoration, and other forms of climate action in aquatic food systems as key pathways for achieving climate change adaptation, food security, and sustainable development."

This past week, the UN system returned to Stockholm after 50 years for a global stock-take on the progress made since then, and to give leaders an opportunity to meet and reestablish momentum behind the sustainable development goals after the major setbacks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. There certainly has been progress made in the last 50 years. The 1972 conference gave birth to the UN Environment Program (UNEP), which was the first UN agency to be based in the Global South and still does important work today, including the production of landmark scientific assessments like those on climate change. The conference also gave heightened prominence to the role of multilateralism in dealing with environmental issues. As then-Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme pointed out in his address to the 1972 conference, “the air we breathe is not the property of any one nation…the big oceans are not divided by national frontiers.” The environment does not see borders; we cannot solve the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution as individuals or as individual countries. We have to work together.\nOf course, “working together” has not exactly characterized environmental action since 1972. For all the multilateral environmental agreements currently in force, the basic social and biophysical aspects of our planetary crisis have only become worse. To be sure, there are examples of success, but they remain few and far between. As a rule, governments have failed to meet treaty obligations, fund key international organizations like UNEP, and maintain our planet’s life support systems. To borrow from Secretary General António Guterres’ opening remarks on Thursday, “we must act on these commitments. Otherwise they are nothing but hot air. And hot air is killing us.”\nAlthough no significant decisions will be made in Stockholm this week, the occasion has provided an opportunity for some governments and civil society groups to put forward proposals that, they hope, might end up being more than hot air. Here are just a few."

Proponents say that the treaty would provide the legal architecture necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming to “well below 2 °C.” With the active and destructive proliferation of fossil fuels around the world, non-proliferation would certainly be a step in the right direction. And current treaties are not delivering. At COP26 in Glasgow, a now-notorious last minute text change meant that countries only agreed to “phase down” coal, rather than phasing it out; the only mention of fossil fuels had to do with “inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.” Slightly less coal and a more economically efficient fossil fuel sector can hardly be called progress. After three decades of climate negotiations, greenhouse gas emissions are still on the rise and fossil fuel companies are still investing in new exploration, extraction, and transport infrastructure at levels wildly incompatible with limiting climate warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Ending the proliferation of fossil fuels is a worthy goal."

Last October, the UN Human Rights Council officially recognized the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment and invited the General Assembly to consider the issue at its next meeting, which will take place this September. The most direct path for this right to become legally binding will be for it to be recognized as a substantive condition for the fulfillment of other human rights already protected under international law. The human right to water, which was recognized by the UN General Assembly in 2010, followed a similar path. Before the right to water was recognized, the Economic and Social Council paved the way for that recognition by submitting a comment arguing that water is a substantial requirement for the rights to health, housing, food, and life. The proponents of the right to environment are hoping for a similar outcome in September."

The Stop Ecocide campaign wants to change that, and while they are working with some national parliaments to establish domestic prohibitions on ecocide, their chief target is the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague. The ICC is dedicated to holding individuals accountable for the very worst crimes—genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and aggression—but none of these offenses sufficiently account for the rights of nature or the harm that comes to human beings when nature is damaged. That is why a growing coalition is working to add ecocide as a crime under the Rome Statute, which would make it a prosecutable offense by the ICC. Doing so would make the large-scale destruction of nature illegal for nationals of, or those who would commit crimes in, 123 countries around the world, an important first step in reversing current ecocidal trends. While the ecocide law’s prospects are probably not great, the movement has certainly gained ground over the last ten years. It has played a very prominent role in discussions at Stockholm+50 and was one of the key demands made in the interfaith statement to the conference assembly, which was signed by around 240 faith-based organizations and presented in plenary on Friday."

    "text": "Global treaty on plastic pollution\nThe global treaty on plastic pollution is one of the more mature initiatives in the air at Stockholm this week. The UN Environment Assembly voted in February to begin negotiations on a legal instrument that would be legally binding, a task they hope to complete by 2024. Negotiations began this week in Dakar, Senegal. Attendees at Stockholm who had arrived directly from Dakar reported that there was significant contention over procedural questions, which are crucial to creating the conditions required to produce an agreement that is ambitious, binding, and enforceable, a rare achievement in international law. As a representative from WWF pointed out at Stockholm this week, “the devil is in the details.” Constructing a good treaty with consistent international standards will do much to determine future plastic production. This treaty cannot come soon enough. A group of 14 scientists published a study in January of this year that showed the world is already outside the safe operating space for plastics and other pollutants. Plastic debris litter the ocean, starve marine life, and are even found in microscopic form in the food we eat and the air we breathe. Managing plastic pollution on a global level, including the development of circular economies and source-to-sea solutions is an obvious, and obviously urgent, next step.\nWhile the treaty on plastic pollution and the human right to a clean and healthy environment are well-positioned to achieve legal force relatively soon, it is likely that the other proposals will not gain that status. That does not mean they are failures. The fact that governments and civil society are even discussing the rights of nature represents a marked shift away from the anthropocentric environmental ethics that prevailed just a few years ago. It is worth noting, however, that all of these proposals are limited by their reliance on the very system that has reproduced the environmental and social crisis over the last 50 years. While we will not build a just and sustainable future without multilateralism, the spiritual, economic, and social conversion required by that future will never be implemented by treaties alone. And the treaties we really need will never be negotiated, signed, and ratified until those deeper reforms are already underway.\nThis post was originally shared on the JENA Blog."

    "text": "Do sustainable fisheries exist?\nSeaspiracy describes sustainable fishing as “something that isn’t working and can’t even be defined.” Neither of these statements are true.\nThe fishery I’ve done much of my research on is incredibly sustainable: it is well-monitored, well-managed, and does no damage to non-target species or the surrounding ecosystem. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 78.7 percent of fish caught and sold by commercial fishing vessels come from sustainable stocks. But what does it mean to say this?\nThere are two common definitions of sustainability that apply to fisheries. The first is quite broad. It comes from the Brundtland Report, a 1987 UN-backed attempt to reconcile economic development with environmental limits. The definition reads,\n\n“sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”\n\nWhile this definition is not perfect, it does contain the core idea behind sustainability: we shouldn’t be taking part in any activity that compromises the wellbeing of future generations. From this perspective, we can think of sustainability as social and economic as well as biological.\nA narrower definition, and one that is more specific to fisheries, is known as “maximum sustainable yield,” or MSY. This is the definition the FAO is using for that 78.7 percent statistic I mentioned earlier. MSY is the maximum amount of fish that can be caught consistently year after year. If you fish at or below MSY, your fishery will be sustainable in this narrow sense of the term.\nThat said, there are still plenty of sustainability challenges, even for fisheries that are operating at or below MSY. Seabirds, turtles, and marine mammals are heavily impacted by fishing, just as land animals are heavily impacted by terrestrial food systems. Ghost gear (fishing nets, buoys, and other equipment lost or abandoned at sea) is also a big problem and a major, although not the leading, source of plastic pollution."

This projection, originally put forward in a 2006 paper published in Science, later turned out to be wrong.\nThe paper, led by Dr. Boris Worm of Dalhousie University, was based on some faulty assumptions having to do with the FAO’s database of global fishery statistics. A few years later, Dr. Worm was the lead author on a follow-up paper, also published in Science, that painted a very different picture of global fisheries. Management efforts that began in earnest in the 1990’s have had measurable success and many fish stocks are rebuilding or have been rebuilt, although overfishing is still a problem in many parts of the world. While fishing has caused severe declines in large, predatory fish species, a future of “empty oceans” does not seem to be in the cards."

These labels are far from meaningless, but it is difficult for consumers to make informed decisions about seafood.\nI recommend eating MSC certified seafood or using Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch website. Know, however, that neither of these systems are perfect and they will sometimes provide you with conflicting information because they use different rating systems.\nMSC and Seafood Watch are great resources, but at the end of the day fisheries sustainability is really complicated, as I hope I’ve highlighted above. It’s not just about what species of fish you’re targeting, but also what gear you’re using, what bycatch is getting caught in your nets (or lines, etc.), what your impact is on marine habitats, and how much carbon you’re emitting along the way. At the same time, doing our best to eat sustainable seafood is not going to stop overfishing. For that, we need international cooperation and policy change."

    "text": "Is trawling just like bulldozing pristine Amazonian rainforest?\nSeaspiracy memorably compares an estimate of the global footprint of bottom trawling with deforestation of the Amazon. It may be a tempting comparison, but bottom trawling and deforestation are just not the same thing.\nWhen we think about deforestation in the Amazon, we imagine total destruction of local ecosystems and the potential of reaching a tipping point that would turn much of the forest into a dry grassland savannah. There are a lot of issues around bottom trawling, especially when it comes to dragging heavy fishing gear over sensitive habitat, but “total destruction” (at least in most cases) and “tipping point” are really not those issues. When trawls are used over soft, muddy parts of the seafloor, the damage they cause, while still real, is much more limited."

    "text": "What are the biggest threats to marine life and what can I do about them?\nAlthough Seaspiracy’s depiction of marine biodiversity loss is a little more extreme than the facts allow, marine ecosystems are under threat.\nClimate change is already the most significant human impact in some marine ecosystems and is the greatest long-term threat faced by our oceans. The oceans are getting warmer and more acidic and marine ecosystems are already undergoing significant changes. In Rhode Island, where I’m from, we used to have a thriving lobster industry, but lobsters have become more scarce, in part due to warming inshore waters. This trend is part of a general poleward shift in many marine species distributions. But climate change is not just about species distributions—some of the scarier possibilities have to do with changes to ocean circulation. Ocean circulation patterns are crucial to supporting marine life and it is not clear what the future will look like if some of these systems break down. The best ways to make a difference in the fight against climate change are to educate yourself and others, support political action for a just and rapid transition away from fossil fuels, and consider ways to limit your own carbon footprint.\nAs I highlighted above, unsustainable fishing practices are a real problem, even if they’re not the whole story. One thing you can do is support organizations working to improve food security and sustainability in the fisheries of developing countries, where there tend to be more ecological and social challenges. At the same time, fisheries sustainability has a lot to do with political and economic power. A more just world is a key prerequisite to sustainable fishing. Another option is to eat local, sustainable seafood or plant-based alternatives. You will never be able to eat a diet that puts no pressure on natural ecosystems, but changing what you eat does decrease your personal footprint.\nPollution from land-based sources is also a key challenge. You’ve probably heard a lot about marine plastics. Another important impact, especially in coastal waters, is nutrient pollution, mostly from agriculture and human waste. When we let our waste and fertilizer overload coastal waters, photosynthetic algae bloom, die, and decompose, leading to low-oxygen areas known as “dead zones.” Dead zones are spreading around the world, are exacerbated by climate change, and actively threaten marine life. Because dead zones heavily depend on local context, there is no cookie-cutter solution. Find a local environmental organization that is working on science-based, justice-oriented solutions to these issues. If you live in a watershed with a lot of agricultural runoff, you may want to find ways to support more sustainable farming practices. If you live in an area with poor wastewater treatment, consider organizing with others to support upgrades to local treatment facilities. I also recommend paying attention to how much stuff, including plastic, you consume and how much trash you produce. Try to limit your footprint in both areas.\nMarine biodiversity is incredibly important, both because our oceans and the biodiversity they contain give glory to God in their own right and because we humans need healthy marine ecosystems in order to live on this planet. Balancing sustainability, food security, and justice concerns is a tall order, but if we all get educated and get involved, we can make a difference.\nCover image by Christoffer Engström on Unsplash\nThis blog was originally shared on The Jesuit Post."

    "section": "Why is food being discussed at COP27?",
    "text": "Why is food being discussed at COP27?\nAgriculture and food security have been at the core of global climate governance from the very beginning. The 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the foundational treaty for global climate governance, states that climate mitigation “should be achieved within a time frame sufficient…to ensure that food production is not threatened.” It also characterizes agriculture as crucial for mitigation (drawing down greenhouse gas emissions) and highly vulnerable to climate impacts. The 2015 Paris Agreement places a similar emphasis on food, mostly in the context of adaptation, and likewise recognizes “the particular vulnerability of food production systems.” Indeed, food systems are the only sector that is named in both of the main legal instruments governing climate change at the global level.\nBecause food systems are so important for climate mitigation and adaptation, the 23rd Conference of the Parties (COP23), held in Bonn in 2017, decided to initiate a work program on agriculture under the UNFCCC, called the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA). Since then, different UN bodies, national governments, and non-governmental observers have worked together to lay out a future for food in global climate governance. They will have an opportunity to conclude the first phase of that work at COP27.\nA few outcomes are possible. The first and best option is that parties decide to form a permanent body to guide the implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation in food systems. This decision would help provide policy and financial support to small-scale producers, empower the UNFCCC to interface with other UN bodies involved in global food governance, and could even contribute to the much-needed transformation of global food systems. A second option would be to delay the decision, which would leave small-scale producers without support for at least another several months. The third option would be to decide on a less robust future for the KJWA. This outcome would be very disappointing and would probably result in increased hunger and malnutrition globally. It would also benefit the large multinational corporations that currently control global food systems."

    "text": "Why is an inclusive and participatory food systems approach so important?\nA permanent body for food under the UNFCCC should take an inclusive and participatory food systems approach. A narrow focus on production, or an even narrower focus on specific kinds of production, would not be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s prioritization of food security. Increasingly, food security is defined according to six pillars: availability of food, access to food, utilization of food, stability of food systems, agency of producers and consumers, and sustainability. Production only accounts for one of these pillars (availability), and excluding important production systems like capture fisheries would not even do that. A broad mandate will be very important.\nBut a systemic approach is not enough. If we take seriously the agency pillar of food security, and if UN member states are to honor their legal commitment to upholding human rights, food systems governance must be inclusive and participatory. Large agribusinesses have the means to attend and influence large international meetings like COP27, but most food producers do not. And yet, more than 70% of the world’s agricultural land is controlled by just 1% of farms, while small family farms use the planet’s remaining cropland to produce 80% of the world’s food in value terms. Democratic principles, not corporate hegemony, must be enshrined in any UNFCCC permanent body. The UN Committee on World Food Security’s Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples’ Mechanism provides a model for this type of governance."

    "text": "Can agroecology be included as part of these efforts?\nPrinciples consistent with agroecology have already been included in the KJWA. These include:\n\nthe use of organic fertilizers that enhance soil biodiversity and do not rely on fossil fuels;\nthe value of incorporating diversification, recycling, and efficiency, and supporting synergies within food systems;\nthe need for inclusive and participatory adaptation centered on small-scale producers, indigenous peoples, local and vulnerable communities, women, and youth; and\nthe inclusion of scientific, local, and indigenous knowledge.\n\nThese principles are not on the agenda for discussion at COP27 because they were already settled in previous meetings. Nonetheless, they could still fall victim to last-minute compromises in the negotiating process. This must not be allowed to happen.\nThe importance of food systems, inclusive and participatory governance, and agroecology were all highlighted in the African Climate Dialogues, a series of discussions held among Catholic Church and secular civil society actors in Africa in the months leading up to COP27. Now, and with the full support of the Catholic Church’s highest body on the continent, world leaders must make meaningful progress by ensuring food systems have a central place in climate governance.\nPhoto: United Nations/M.
