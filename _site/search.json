However, as Narragansett Bay becomes more oligotrophic and experiences fewer episodes of hypoxia due to improved wastewater treatment and the effects of climate change, trophic relationships are changing in space and time. I collaborated with researchers at Loyola University Chicago and the Rhode Island Division of Marine Fisheries to study the impacts of these changes on Narragansett Bay quahogs and found evidence for a hypoxia-induced predation refuge that is becoming less influential as water quality improves (Galligan, Stuart, et al., 2022).\n\nGalligan, B.

    "text": "Ecological justice for sustainable fisheries\nAs a Jesuit in formation to be a Catholic priest, I am deeply inspired by the thought of Pope Francis, who writes (2015, no. 139):\n\nFrancis. (2015). Laudato si’: Encyclical letter on care for our common home.\n\n“We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.”\n\nMy own “integrated approach” incorporates ethical reflection and advocacy alongside scientific research. It also influences what questions I choose to ask and how I seek to answer them (Zepeda & Galligan, 2023). While studying ethics at Loyola University Chicago, I developed a critique of international ocean governance that identified an extractivist paradigm in global fisheries (Galligan, 2021). More recently, I worked with a community on Kenya’s north coast to share their story of seeking remedy for human rights violations perpetrated by the government (Galligan & Kinney, 2021).\n\nZepeda, C.
