# Welcome!

I am a Jesuit scholastic and marine ecologist interested in coastal ecosystems and sustainable fisheries. Most of my work has focused on the intersection between fisheries and food security, including a significant emphasis on East African coral reefs. I have also studied commercial fisheries in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, U.S.A., conducted advocacy at  U.N. climate negotiations, and have an ongoing interest in justice-oriented approaches to ocean governance.

I believe marine science can be a powerful tool for ecological justice, particularly when it is practiced in dialogue with communities and decision makers.

To find out more about me and my work, explore this website and/or read [my CV](data-files/galligan-cv.pdf). To find out more about the Jesuits, including our training process and the types of work we do, click [here](https://beajesuit.org).
