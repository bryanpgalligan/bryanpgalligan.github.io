Welcome! I am a [Jesuit](research.qmd#sec-jesuit) scholastic and marine scientist interested in sustainable fisheries and aquatic food systems. While remaining rooted in the discipline and techniques of marine fisheries ecology, I also seek to collaborate and work across disciplines to create a future that is environmentally sustainable and socially just.
