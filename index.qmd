# Welcome!

I am a Jesuit scholastic and marine ecologist interested in sustainable fisheries and ecological justice. Most of my work has focused on the intersection between fisheries and food security, including a significant emphasis on East African coral reefs. I have also worked on commercial fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic and am broadly interested in coastal ecosystems, functional ecology, and generating policy advice.

As a Jesuit in formation for priesthood in the Catholic Church, I am deeply inspired by Pope Francis' encyclical, [*Laudato si'*](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html), and the intersectional paradigm it develops called "integral ecology."

To find out more, explore this website and/or read [my CV](data-files/galligan-cv.pdf).
