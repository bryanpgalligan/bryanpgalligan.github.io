# Welcome!

I am a Jesuit scholastic and fisheries scientist interested in solving complex sustainability problems through the lens of integral ecology. The driving force behind my work is a desire to produce the type of knowledge that will support social and ecological transformation in marine systems. I currently focus on the intersection between marine fisheries ecology and food systems governance, and I enjoy finding ways to connect my research to specific policy processes with concrete outcomes. My areas of interest include nutrition-sensitive fisheries management, functional ecology, the ecosystem impacts of climate change, and ocean governance.

As a Jesuit in formation to be a Catholic priest, I am deeply influenced by the thought of Pope Francis, who writes:

> "We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature" ([*Laudato si'*](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html), 139)

This is what I aim to do as a professional scientist and amateur ethicist. For more on this aspect of my work, I invite you to explore the integral ecoloy section on my [research](research.qmd) page.
