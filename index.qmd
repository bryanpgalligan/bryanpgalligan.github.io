I am a Jesuit scholastic and marine scientist working at the intersection of fisheries and food security. Click [here](publications.qmd) for a list of my recent publications and [here](media.qmd) for media coverage of me and my work.

Most of my scholarly effort is directed towards the development of sustainable marine fisheries that provide food and nutrition security to tropical coastal communities. This line of inquiry is inspired by my Catholic faith and Ignatian spirituality, which find the wonder of God in all things, seek to achieve justice for humans and nature, and value interdisciplinary perspectives and dialogue.

## Research

In the Western Indian Ocean, I study the ecology, management, and governance of artisanal coral reef fisheries. This work has included a strong focus on the production of nutrients for human consumption and on management approaches designed to support the food security and nutrition of coastal communities.

I have also studied commercial fisheries in the northeastern United States, where my work has focused on characterizing the changing dynamics of species-ecosystem interactions to support improved stock assessment and management.

I periodically write about marine policy and governance from a social justice perspective.
