# Welcome!

I am a Jesuit scholastic and fisheries scientist working to solve complex sustainability problems through the lens of integral ecology. The driving force behind my work is a desire to produce the type of knowledge that will support social and ecological transformation in marine systems. I currently focus on the intersection between marine fisheries ecology and food systems governance, and I strive to connect my research to specific policy processes with concrete outcomes. My areas of interest include small-scale fisheries, blue foods, and ocean governance. To find out more about me and my work, explore this website or read my CV [here](data-files/galligan-cv.pdf).
