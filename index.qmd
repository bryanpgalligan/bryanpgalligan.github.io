Welcome! I am a Jesuit scholastic and marine scientist with a background in ecology and social ethics. I am interested in using the tools of fisheries science to build sustainable and resilient aquatic food systems through research that is engaged with communities and policy. I primarily study coral reef artisanal fisheries in the Global South, but I also write about commercial fisheries in the United States as well as broader issues of ethics in ocean governance.

My current work uses ecological modeling to inform policy and management. In tropical fisheries, I have studied the production of nutrients for human consumption and the role of traditional biomass-based management in supporting food security and nutrition. In the Northeastern U.S., my work has focused on characterizing the changing dynamics of species-ecosystem interactions to support improved stock assessment and management, specifically for Northern Quahog *Mercenaria mercenaria* and Winter Flounder *Pseudopleuronectes americanus*.
