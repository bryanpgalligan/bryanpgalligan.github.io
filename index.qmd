I am a Jesuit scholastic and marine fisheries ecologist interested in coastal ecosystems and their sustainability. My current work focuses on modeling ecological processes to inform policy and management, both for Western Indian Ocean coral reefs and for commercial fisheries in the Northeastern United States. I am also interested in the intersection of science and theology, particularly in the context of ecological ethics and environmental justice.
