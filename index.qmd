# Welcome!

I am a Jesuit scholastic and fisheries scientist interested in solving complex sustainability problems through the lens of integral ecology. The driving force behind my work is a desire to produce the type of knowledge that will support social and ecological transformation in marine systems. I currently focus on the intersection between marine fisheries ecology and food systems governance, and I enjoy finding ways to connect my research to specific policy processes with concrete outcomes. My areas of interest include nutrition-sensitive fisheries management, functional ecology, the ecosystem impacts of climate change, and ocean governance.
