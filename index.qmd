Welcome! I am a Jesuit scholastic and marine scientist with a background in fisheries ecology and social ethics. My interests include coral reef fisheries, climate change adaptation, and their intersections with human health and well being, especially food security and nutrition.

## Research

In the Western Indian Ocean, I study the ecology, management, and governance of artisanal coral reef fisheries. This work has included a strong focus on the production of nutrients for human consumption and on management approaches designed to support the food security and nutrition of coastal communities.

In the northeastern United States, my work has focused on characterizing the changing dynamics of species-ecosystem interactions to support improved stock assessment and management, specifically for Northern Quahog *Mercenaria mercenaria* and Winter Flounder *Pseudopleuronectes americanus*.
