I have broad interests and am always open to taking things in a new direction. These are the projects I'm currently working on.

## Nutrient yields from small-scale fisheries

Small-scale fisheries (SSF) are an important source of food, nutrition, and income in developing countries, but they face many challenges and are often neglected in policy and management. In addition to providing important benefits for people, SSF often take place in highly complex social and ecological systems and tend to be understudied relative to industrial fisheries. This project uses catch data and information about the nutritional value of fished species to ask questions about social and ecological trade offs in fishery management. Can we sustainably increase the quantity and quality of food produced by SSF? Can we preserve coral reef ecological function without compromising food security? The first publication from this project shows that managing Kenyan trap fisheries to target fish with larger, more sustainable body sizes is associated with improved nutrient yields [@galligan2022].

## Social justice and human rights in ocean governance

Current models of ocean governance often marginalize small-scale actors and fail to deliver on international human rights obligations. In this project, I advance criticisms that highlight the negative social and environmental impacts of these harmful governance models and advocate for more just alternatives, such as human rights-based and nutrition-sensitive approaches. In this context, I work to occupy a space of radical critique while still offering feasible solutions. The outcomes of this project include publications on extractivism in UNCLOS [@galligan2021] and blue justice in Kenya [@galligankinney2021].

## Integral ecology in research, policy, and practice

As a Jesuit in formation to be a Catholic priest, I am deeply inspired by the thought of Pope Francis, who [writes](https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html):

> "We are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature."

Francis believes that these integrated, solution-oriented strategies should take on the contours of what he calls "integral ecology." This project, which I am working on in collaboration with the [Laudato Si' Research Institute](https://lsri.campion.ox.ac.uk/), is about figuring out what integral ecology means for research, policy, and practice. How does an integral ecology paradigm invite new approaches to knowledge production? Are these methods different for academics from different disciplines? And how can natural scientists develop new approaches to environmental problems without sacrificing disciplinary integrity or rigor?
